## The Project

Patinhas Felizes is a web application to help animals shelters managing its animals. It was born in 2022 through my Web Development classes, but it was initially built with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/).

Now, I'm rebuilding it using some of the newest technologies.

## Technologies

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - [React.js](https://pt-br.legacy.reactjs.org/) + JavaScript.

- [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

Some other libraries were used, as you can check below:

- [React Toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/) - to show up users beautiful toasts, instead of building them by myself.
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - to manage and validate easily each form inside the application.

- [React Tables](https://react-table-library.com/) - I now what you're thinking haha.
